## User Story

```md
AS AN avid gamer who thrives on competition and fast-paced activities
I WANT a CMS-style game which allows me to compete under time pressure as a wizard to make my enemies disappear as fast as I can
SO THAT I can unwind after a long day of coding and have some fun!
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a CMS-style blog-style site
WHEN I visit the site for the first time
THEN I am presented with a login and register window
WHEN I log in or register
THEN I am presented with a Player dashboard so I can choose a wizard avatar and read the rules of the game
WHEN I have chosen a wizard avatar and have finished reading the rules
THEN I press the “Go!” button
WHEN I press the “Go!” button
THEN I am taken to the game page with a sixty-second countdown which begins immediately
WHEN the enemies … 
THEN I am able to control my avatar 
WHEN this happens …  
THEN I lose points ...
WHEN this happens ...
THEN something else happens ...
WHEN the timer runs out or the points of my avatar reaches zero
THEN a message is shown saying that the game is over
AND my score is shown (with my user name) 
WHEN the game is over
THEN I am presented my score and a prompt asking if I would like to play again
WHEN I choose "yes"
THEN the game runs again
WHEN I choose "no"
THEN I am exited from the game
WHEN I exit from the game
THEN I see a leaderboard page with my score included with all other high scores from other players
WHEN I visit the site for subsequent times
THEN I do not have to re-enter my login details as they are saved via cookies???
